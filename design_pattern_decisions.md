# Design pattern decisions

## Fail early, fail loud pattern

`require()` statements are used as soon as possible to ensure that code with invalid parameters is not executed.
Another benefit of the this design pattern is that using `require()` immediately shows that the function did not execute correctly.

## Restricting access pattern

The shop consists of 3 roles - `admins`, `shop owners` and `normal users`. This pattern is utilized to that different roles have access
different functionality in the smart contract. For example:
  - Only admins can add new shop owners and other admins and stop the contract (emergency).
  - Only shop owners can add new shops, edit their products and manage their shops' funds.
  - Normal users can only purchase products from a store.

## Emergency stop pattern

In case of emergency an admin can stop the contract. This prevents people from modifiying the state of the contract and disables
all payable functions.
